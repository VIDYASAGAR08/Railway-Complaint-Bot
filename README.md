# Train Complaint Bot

## Project Description
The *Train Complaint Bot* is an AI-powered chatbot designed to handle passenger complaints related to train travel.

## Features
- âœ… *Automated Complaint Handling* â€“ Categorizes and processes complaints efficiently.
- âœ… *Natural Language Understanding* â€“ Uses an LLM to understand user inputs.
- âœ… *Live Status Updates* â€“ Fetches real-time train information (if APIs are integrated).
- âœ… *User-Friendly UI* â€“ Provides an animated and visually appealing interface.

## Technologies Used
- *Frontend:* Streamlit (Python UI framework)
- *Backend:* Python, FastAPI (if needed)
- *LLM:* OpenAI GPT, Google Bard, or any suitable model
